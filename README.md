# D209-Data-Mining-1
Task 1: Classification Analysis
This task involves using a classification method (either K-Nearest Neighbor or Naive Bayes) to address a real-world organizational question. The process begins with defining the question and goal, justifying the chosen method, and identifying key assumptions. Data preparation includes cleaning, preprocessing, and classifying variables as numeric or categorical. The analysis splits the data into training and test sets, applies the classification method, and evaluates the model based on accuracy and area under the curve (AUC). The final step summarizes the results, discusses implications, identifies a limitation of the analysis, and recommends actionable steps based on the findings to address the organizational situation.

Task 2: Predictive Analysis
This task focuses on solving a real-world organizational problem using predictive modeling methods, such as decision trees, random forests, or advanced regression techniques like lasso or ridge regression. It begins with defining a prediction question and goal, selecting a method, and justifying its suitability with assumptions and relevant libraries. Data preparation involves cleaning, identifying variables as numeric or categorical, and preparing the data for analysis. The data is split into training and test sets, and the predictive model is applied. The evaluation focuses on metrics like accuracy and mean squared error (MSE) to assess model performance. The results, implications, and a limitation are discussed, concluding with a recommendation for action based on the analysis.
